# twitter-ads-golang-sdk

At this moment there is no official SDK for Twitter Ads API for Go programming language [sdk tools and libraries](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/tools-and-libraries). 
The purpose of this library is to fetch spend statistics by active twitters campaign. The process of creating a signature for making requests to the Twitter API is a little tricky and can be confusing due to the large number of steps that must be taken to create a signature for each request [creating a signature](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/creating-a-signature). That's why I decided to share this tool with usage example to save your time. Please feel free to use it and improve it.
